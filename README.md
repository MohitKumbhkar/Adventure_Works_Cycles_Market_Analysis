# Adventure_Works_Cycles_Market_Analysis
End-to-end Business Intelligence Solution using Power BI
## Project Summary
This project was built as part of the Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence course by Maven Analytics on Udemy. Using Microsoft's Adventure Works OLTP database, I created a complete BI solution for a fictional company, Adventure Works Cycles. The project involved transforming data with Power Query, building a relational model, and using DAX to create calculated columns and measures. The final result is a 2-page interactive Power BI report that showcases KPIs such as sales, revenue, profit, returns, regional performance, product trends, forecasts, and high-value customer insights.
